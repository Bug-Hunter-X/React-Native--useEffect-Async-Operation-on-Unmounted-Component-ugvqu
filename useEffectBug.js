This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation, such as a network request, and the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes.  This leads to a warning in the console and potential unexpected behavior.  The error arises because the `useEffect` cleanup function is not executed, and the asynchronous operation might still be trying to update state or perform other actions after the component has been unmounted, causing errors.
